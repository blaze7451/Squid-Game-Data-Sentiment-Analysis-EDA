Exploratory data analysis and sentiment analysis of the tweets about Squid game drama. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/squid-game-netflix-twitter-data) is from the kaggle, and it is, as the original collector said, a dataset data collected using tweepy Python package to access Twitter API.

The work here surveys the sentiment of each tweet and various properties of the positives, negative, and neutral tweets respectively. The sentiment of each tweet is determined by the vader class in NLTK module. After the sentiment of each tweet is determined, I further analyzed the most common hashtags, source distribution, retweet, most frequently occuring words and etc. of each sentiment group.
